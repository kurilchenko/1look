A comfortable VR adventure where you have fun exploring and interacting with a magical setting at your own pace—without a time constraint, sore neck, and, hopefully, nausea. It can be played on a fixed chair, handsfree—all actionable things are always in front of you, to interact you just look at an object for a second or so.
