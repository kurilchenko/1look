# Wendy
Play as Wendy—a young woman who always imagined herself as a witch. Cuddled up with your pet cat, you sit alone one Halloween night, drinking wine and eating candy—you find yourself falling asleep and into a dream.

You awake in a magical tower with the power of telekinesis—tinker and move objects by simply looking at them for a second or so. Tasked with brewing a potion, you must solve a series of puzzles, collecting ingredients and adding them to a cauldron.

The game is designed to be a comfortable experience: have fun at your own pace without a time constraint or sore neck.

Wendy is made in collaboration with [Korigame](https://twitter.com/Korigame)—a talented game designed and an artist.
