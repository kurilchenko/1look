# Wendy
Play as Wendy—a young witch with a strong power of telekinesis. Use her power for fun: push and tinker with stuff, search for potion ingredients using recipes from a witchcraft book, explore a tower that you find yourself in. You can open new layers to the tower by making potions. Each layer of the tower has new stuff to explore and objects to play.

The game designed to be as comfortable as possible. Have fun exploring and interacting with a magical setting at your own pace—without a time constraint, sore neck, and, hopefully, nausea. Wendy can be played on a fixed chair, handsfree—all actionable things are always in front of you, to interact you just look at an object for a second or so.
